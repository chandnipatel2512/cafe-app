# cafe-app

A client has launched a pop-up cafe in a busy business district. They are offering delivered home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders.

As a business:
• I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.

• When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the system.

• I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered.

• When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.

• When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.

• I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.

• I need to receive regular software updates.
